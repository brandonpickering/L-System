An implementation of a parametric L-system interpreter. The syntax is specified in syntax.txt, but some things (e.g. stochastic rule application) aren't implemented.

The turtle directory contains a turtle graphics drawing program using L-systems, along with a sample .lsys file for a tree. Pressing the up/down key increases/decreases the number of steps.
