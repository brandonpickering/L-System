    <h1>L-System Interpreter</h1>
    <div class="project-page-img"><img src="turtle/result.gif"></div>
    <p>An L-system is a rewriting system with strings of symbols as terms and a set of production rules to expand substrings. They are useful for modeling organic forms. This is an implementation of a parametric L-system interpreter written in C++.</p>
    <p>The interpreter includes a simple turtle graphics display, which can generate models like the one above.</p>
